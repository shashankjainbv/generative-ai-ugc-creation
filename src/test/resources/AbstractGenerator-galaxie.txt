Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignicant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
This planet has or rather had a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.
Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place.
And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she nally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place.
This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever.
This is not her story.
But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences.
It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman.
Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.
In fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor of which no Earthman had ever heard either.
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?
In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects.
First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words Don't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.
But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply.
It begins with a house.
The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village.
It stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of West Country farmland.
Not a remarkable house by any means it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye.
The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in.
He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable.
He was about thirty as well, dark haired and never quite at ease with himself.
The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about.
He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought.
It was, too most of his friends worked in advertising.
On Wednesday night it had rained very heavily, the lane was wet and muddy, but the Thursday morning sun was bright and clear as it shone on Arthur Dent's house for what was to be the last time It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock down his house and build an bypass instead.
At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very good.
He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash.
Toothpaste on the brush so.
Scrub.
Shaving mirror pointing at the ceiling.
He adjusted it.
For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window.
Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent's bristles.
He shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth.
Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee.
Yawn.
The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with.
The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one.
He stared at it.
Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another.
He began to suspect that he was hung over.
Why was he hung over?
Had he been drinking the night before?
He supposed that he must have been.
He caught a glint in the shaving mirror.
He stood and thought.
The pub, he thought.
Oh dear, the pub.
He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important.
He'd been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people's faces.
Something about a new bypass he had just found out about.
It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it.
Ridiculous.
He took a swig of water.
It would sort itself out, he'd decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn't have a leg to stand on.
It would sort itself out.
God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though.
He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror.
He stuck out his tongue.
The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with.
Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path.
Mr. L. Prosser was, as they say, only human.
In other words he was a carbon-based life form descended from an ape.
More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council.
Curiously enough, though he didn't know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L. Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats.
He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous worried man.
Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job which was to see that Arthur Dent's house got cleared out of the way before the day was out.
You can't lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely."
He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn't do it.
Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.
Mr. Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again.
Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point A to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A very fast.
People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people of point B are so keen to get there, and what's so great about point B that so many people of point A are so keen to get there.
They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the heck they wanted to be.
Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D.
Point D wasn't anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C.
He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D.
His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes.
He didn't know why he just liked axes.
He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers.
He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each.
Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him.
The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday.
I asked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no he'd come to demolish the house.
He didn't tell me straight away of course.
Oh no.
First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a faver.
A cloud passed overhead.
It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud.
It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent's house.
Mr. Prosser frowned at it.
Mr. Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent's house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back.
Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous.
He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together.
Prosser, and stormed nervously off wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him.
By a curious coincidence, "None at all" is exactly how much suspicion the ape-descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually claimed.
Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.
This friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen Earth years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society with, it must be said, some success.
For instance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough.
He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit on his preparatory research.
The information he had gathered had led him to choose the name "Ford Prefect" as being nicely inconspicuous.
He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicuously handsome.
His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from the temples.
His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose.
There was something very slightly odd about him, but it was difficult to say what it was.
Perhaps it was that his eyes didn't blink often enough and when you talked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on his behalf.
Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck.
He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but a harmless one an unruly boozer with some oddish habits.
For instance he would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun of any astrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out.
Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing.
Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin.
Evenings like this usually ended badly.
Ford would get out of his skull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn't matter that much really.
Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse.
The policemen would usually say something like, "Don't you think it's about time you went off home sir?"
In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer at all.
The reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.
Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would arrive soon because fteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth.
Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them.
He knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan dollars a day.
In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the environs of Arthur's house had settled into a steady routine.
It was Arthur's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book; it was Mr. Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, the March of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bulldozer drivers' accepted role to sit around drinking co ee and experimenting with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their nancial advantage.
The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course.
The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in.
A shadow moved across him again.
Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect standing above him.
They don't have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often failed to notice it unless he was concentrating.
For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car.
Then suddenly he squatted down beside Arthur.
Now.
He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant.
He pointed at Prosser.
Ford glanced at him, puzzled.
Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that his will was beginning to weaken.
He didn't realize that this was because of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the hyperspace ports that served the madranite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta.
The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was played like this: Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each of them.
Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his opponent who would then have to drink it.
The bottle would then be refilled.
The game would be played again.
And again.
Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic power.
As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the nal loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological.
Ford Prefect usually played to lose.
Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go to the Horse and Groom after all.
Ford looked across to Mr. Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought struck him.
Mr. Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer drivers about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental health hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did) looked around.
He was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that Arthur had company.
Mr. Prosser thought about this.
He thought that one of them wasn't making a lot of sense.
Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty.
He frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once, failed, grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head.
He could only presume that he had just won.
As soon as Mr. Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it.
He sighed.
He turned to Arthur.
Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream.
Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the mud.
He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it.
The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed into his shoes.
Ford looked at him severely.
He saw the bulldozer driver's union representative approaching and let his head sink back and closed his eyes.
He was trying to marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a mental health hazard himself.
He was far from certain about this his mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and the stench of blood.
This always happened when he felt miserable and put upon, and he had never been able to explain it to himself.
In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty Khan bellowed with rage, but Mr. Prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered.
He began to fell little pricks of water behind the eyelids.
What a day.
Arthur remained very worried.
Here's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol.
It says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain carbon-based life forms.
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol.
It says that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.
It says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.
The Guide also tells you on which planets the best Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterwards.
The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself.
Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit, it says.
Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V Oh that Santraginean sea water, it says.
Oh, those Santraginean sh! Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost).
Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.
Over the back of a silver spoon oat a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic.
Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger.
Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.
Sprinkle Zamphuor.
Add an olive.
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than the Encyclopedia Galactica.
He pushed his glasses up his nose and blinked at Ford Prefect.
Ford ignored him and stared out of the window, so the barman looked instead at Arthur who shrugged helplessly and said nothing.
He tried again.
He frowned.
The barman breathed in heavily.
Arthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again.
He turned and smiled wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them had heard what was going on.
None of them had, and none of them could understand what he was smiling at them for.
A man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men, looked at the six pints, did a swift burst of mental arithmetic, arrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid hopeful grin at them.
Ford slapped a five-pound note on the bar.
Ford ignored him.
It really wasn't worth bothering at the moment, what with the world being about to end.
The rest of the pub frowned at him.
A man waved at him to stop smiling at them and mind his own business.
On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds.
They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the star Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing.
The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment.
The huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed over Cape Canaveral without a blip, Woomera and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these years.
The only place they registered at all was on a small black device called a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic which winked away quietly to itself.
It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which Ford Prefect wore habitually round his neck.
The contents of Ford Prefect's satchel were quite interesting in fact and would have made any Earth physicist's eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scripts for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top.
Besides the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb a short squat black rod, smooth and matt with a couple of at switches and dials at one end; he also had a device which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator.
This had about a hundred tiny at press buttons and a screen about four inches square on which any one of a million "pages" could be summoned at a moment's notice.
It looked insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words Don't Panic printed on it in large friendly letters.
The other reason was that this device was in fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
The reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitchhiker would require several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in.
Beneath that in Ford Prefect's satchel were a few biros, a notepad, and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer.
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels.
A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.
Partly it has great practical value you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-tohand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it presumed that if you can't see it, it can't see you daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.
More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.
For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically presume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, ask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc.
Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have "lost".
What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.
Miles above the surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out.
At Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea.
Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him.
Ford clicked his tongue in irritation.
At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside filtered through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of the jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping over the whisky Ford had eventually bought him.
Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet.
Suddenly Ford's spell was broken.
Arthur looked wildly around him and ran to the window.
He made no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime.
Turning quickly to the barman he asked for four packets of peanuts.
The barman looked at it and then looked at Ford.
He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary sensation that he didn't understand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before.
In moments of great stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny subliminal signal.
This signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that being is from the place of his birth.
On Earth it is never possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really isn't very far, so such signals are too minute to be noticed.
Ford Prefect was at this moment under great stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near vicinity of Betelgeuse.
The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, incomprehensible sense of distance.
He didn't know what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost awe.
He was at his flippest.
Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid everyone had become.
The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now.
His eyes waved their way up to Ford.
The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly enough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again.
The girl he had dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour or so, and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide.
However, when the moment came she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice it.
The barman cleared his throat.
Ford knew they were there.
This wasn't the way he had wanted it.
Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house.
He didn't notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn't notice the wind, he didn't notice the sudden irrational squall of rain.
He didn't notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home.
Very very fast.
Prosser was staring hectically into the sky.
What Mr. Prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were screaming through the clouds.
Impossibly huge yellow somethings.
At last he noticed that something was going on.
His finger shot upwards.
Whatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness, tore the sky apart with mind-buggering noise and leapt off into the distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that drove your ears six feet into your skull.
Another one followed and did the same thing only louder.
It's difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were doing now, because they didn't really know what they were doing themselves.
None of it made a lot of sense running into houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly at the noise.
All around the world city streets exploded with people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and then rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit.
Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears.
He knew exactly what was happening and had known ever since his Sub-Etha Sens-OMatic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillar and woken him with a start.
It was what he had waited for all these years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern sitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had gripped him and squeezed his heart.
Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn't it just have to be the Vogons.
Still he knew what he had to do.
As the Vogon craft screamed through the air high above him he opened his satchel.
He threw away a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he threw away a copy of Godspell: He wouldn't need them where he was going.
Everything was ready, everything was prepared.
He knew where his towel was.
A sudden silence hit the Earth.
If anything it was worse than the noise.
For a while nothing happened.
The great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on Earth.
Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a blasphemy against nature.
Many people went straight into shock as their minds tried to encompass what they were looking at.
The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.
And still nothing happened.
Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of open ambient sound.
Every hifi set in the world, every radio, every television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, every mid-range driver in the world quietly turned itself on.
Every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every wine glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically perfect sounding board.
Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address system ever built.
But there was no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a simple message.
Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep.
The process will take slightly less that two of your Earth minutes.
Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth.
The terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were iron fillings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them.
Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but there was nowhere to flee to.
Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again.
The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power.
On the underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black space.
By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter, located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back to the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet.
Nobody ever heard what they said, they only heard the reply.
The PA slammed back into life again.
The voice was annoyed.
There was a terrible ghastly silence.
There was a terrible ghastly noise.
There was a terrible ghastly silence.
The Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry void.
Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, ve hundred thousand light years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the seas of Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and ashing in the Damogran sun.
Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost totally unheard of.
Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold.
The boat sped on across the water.
